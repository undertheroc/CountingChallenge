# AI-Based Approach – CountingChallenge

This folder contains my AI-based solution for the object counting challenge using deep learning models.

### Objective
To detect and count objects in images by leveraging neural network-based image segmentation or detection models, with a minimum accuracy of 95%.

### Approach
- Preprocess input images (resize, normalize)
- Use a CNN or U-Net-based segmentation model
- Train model on labeled mask dataset
- Predict on new inputs to generate binary mask overlays
- Post-process masks to count distinct regions

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib

### Files
- `train.py` – Trains segmentation/detection model
- `predict.py` – Runs inference and saves mask output
- `model.py` – Neural network architecture (e.g., U-Net)
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies

### Output
- Predicted masks over input images
- Total count of detected objects
- Visualizations of prediction vs ground truth (if available)
